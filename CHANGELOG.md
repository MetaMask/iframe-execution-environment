## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.1]
### Added
- Optional `endowments` param to `executeSnap` RPC method ([#39](https://github.com/MetaMask/iframe-execution-environment/pull/39))

### Added
- Versioned deployment ([#36](https://github.com/MetaMask/iframe-execution-environment/pull/36), [#37](https://github.com/MetaMask/iframe-execution-environment/pull/37))
  - Future versions of this project will be published to GitHub pages at `https://metamask.github.io/iframe-execution-environment/<version>`, where `<version>` is a version of this project. Previous versions will be retained on GitHub pages so that breaking changes to the execution environment API does not break existing uses of this project.
  - We will temporarily retain the current version, [0.2.0], of this project at `https://metamask.github.io/iframe-execution-environment` to avoid breaking existing uses of this project. The [0.2.0] distribution of this project will be removed in the near future.

## [0.0.6]
### Fixed
