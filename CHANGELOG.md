  - The implementation of the execution environment has moved from this package to `@metamask/execution-environments`, and several breaking changes were introduced. See the [changelog of the new package](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/blob/main/packages/execution-environments/CHANGELOG.md#0100) for details.

## [0.3.1]

### Fixed
- **BREAKING:** SES `Compartment` endowment safety issues ([#40](https://github.com/MetaMask/iframe-execution-environment/pull/40))
  - This required removing some endowments that were previously available by default.

### Added
- Versioned deployment ([#36](https://github.com/MetaMask/iframe-execution-environment/pull/36), [#37](https://github.com/MetaMask/iframe-execution-environment/pull/37))
  - Future versions of this project will be published to GitHub pages at `https://metamask.github.io/iframe-execution-environment/<version>`, where `<version>` is a version of this project. Previous versions will be retained on GitHub pages so that breaking changes to the execution environment API does not break existing uses of this project.
  - We will temporarily retain the current version, [0.2.0], of this project at `https://metamask.github.io/iframe-execution-environment` to avoid breaking existing uses of this project. The [0.2.0] distribution of this project will be removed in the near future.

## [0.2.0]

## [0.0.7]
### Added
- Uncaught promise rejection error handling ([#24](https://github.com/MetaMask/iframe-execution-environment/pull/24))

## [0.0.6]
### Fixed
- Stop responding twice in case of RPC method errors ([#21](https://github.com/MetaMask/iframe-execution-environment/pull/21))
  - We were sending a second, faulty response from the execution environment whenever an RPC method errored. This is now fixed.

## [0.0.5]
### Added
- JSON-RPC Error support for `executePlugin` ([#19](https://github.com/MetaMask/iframe-execution-environment/pull/19))

## [0.0.4]

  - This fixes compatibility with the MetaMask extension.

## [0.0.3]
